Just a simple HTML form:

   * an input email
   * a text area message
   * a send submit button

When you click on the send submit button, it obviously send the message by mail to the recipient set in the email input!

To do that, you have to use a PHP Backend, check the official documentation, there is a function for that.
Setup

sudo apt-get install sendmail

Bonus

    Use Bootstrap OR Fundation OR Material Design Light
    Check if the mail address is valid (use REGEX)
    Limit the size of the message to 500 characters
    Let user add multiple recipients in email input
    Allow emoji, bold text, images, file attachements, even youtube videos
    Or anything else that you think is a cool feature!
